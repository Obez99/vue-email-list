# Vue Email List

**Description**:<br>
This is my first attempt making an API call using **axios** in **Vue.js**.

**NOTE**: This exercises has two versions (standard and bonus).

- Features of the standard version:
  - Makes a different API call for each email.

- Features of the bonus version:
  - Makes a different API call for each email, but shows the email list after every call is completed.
